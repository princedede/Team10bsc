# Tendity
Binance smart chain project ~ Identity request and verification

What is Tendity?

Tendity is a Decentralized Application that aims to bridge the gap between clients and institutions. Traditionally, the biggest issue users face when trying to connect to a certain institution is the registration process. The whole process of ID request from the institution to verification takes a while.
Tendity is here to solve the problem. We are creating a platform of universal identity management system.
